## Project overview

You'll find two modules in this project: a client and a server.

The client uses React + Typescript in a standard create-react-app setup, while the server uses Spring (Boot) + Kotlin.

## Demo time

1. Start your Spring Boot based server by running `Server.kt` in the server project.
2. Start the react client by running `npm start` in the client project.
3. Open your browser at http://localhost:3000
